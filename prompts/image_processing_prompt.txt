These are images of a wine list. Extract the list of wines with their region and price information under each category: "Sparkling", "White", "Rose", "Orange", "Red", and "Other". Use "*" to denote the list. If there are no wines under a category, say "None" in that category. Do not add any leading or finishing sentences. Include a currency denominator before the price (default is $ for USD).
